# RaytracerRe Repository

Overhauled version of the original [Raytracer repository] (https://github.com/iliyankg/Raytracer).

#### Built on:
* GLUT
* GLEW
* GLM

With both a CPU and GPU implementation this project serves as a basic raytracing example encorporating basic features like Phong shading,
soft shadows and accomodates for recursive reflections.

##### Changes from the original

* Overhauled code structure;
* Re-design of the entire CPU rendering pipeline;
* Removed all deprecated code
